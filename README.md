## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Serve the project with any static file server or simply open `index.html` in your browser. When using modern browsers it is recommended to serve the files via HTTP (e.g. with `npx serve`) due to the use of ES modules.

Once loaded, you can start adding tasks right away.
